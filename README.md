## Description

Pettr lets you keep track of the dogs you pet! Finally, a dedicated app to petting doggos. 

Create a profile for you (and your pet!) and start keeping track of all those dogs you meet.

## Installation
### Tests
To use this app, just clone the repository and, in the command line, run `rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` to set up the test database and run the tests in the spec folder with `rspec`. 
### Launch Server
If all tests pass, launch the server with `thin start` and navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the homepage.
### Pet Doggos
Then simply log-in/sign-up to get started. Happy petting :)
